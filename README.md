# Maven-Fuzzy-Bear
Cindy is close to securing Maven Fuzzy Factory’s next round of funding, and she needs your 
help to tell a compelling story to investors. You’ll need to pull the relevant data, and help your 
CEO craft a story about a data-driven company that has been producing rapid growth.

Extract and analyze traffic and website performance data to craft a growth story that your  CEO can sell. Dive in to the marketing channel activities and the website improvements that  have contributed to your success to date, and use the opportunity to flex your analytical skills  for the investors while you’re at it.

Along the way solving numerous questions such as :

1.)**show our volume growth. Can you pull overall session and order volume, trended by quarter 
for the life of the business? Since the most recent quarter is incomplete, you can decide how to handle it**

2.)**I would love to show quarterly figures since we 
launched, for session-to-order conversion rate, revenue per order, and revenue per session.**

3.)**Please pull monthly sessions to the /products 
page, and show how the % of those sessions clicking through another page has changed over time, along with 
a view of how conversion from /products to placing an order has improved.**
